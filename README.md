# /last30days v2

**The AI world reinvents itself every month. This Claude Code skill keeps you current.** /last30days researches your topic across Reddit, X, and the web from the last 30 days, finds what the community is actually upvoting and sharing, and writes you a prompt that works today, not six months ago. Whether it's Ralph Wiggum loops, Suno music prompts, or the latest Midjourney techniques, you'll prompt like someone who's been paying attention.

**New in V2:** Dramatically better search results. Smarter query construction finds posts that V1 missed entirely, and a new two-phase search automatically discovers key @handles and subreddits from initial results, then drills deeper. Also: free X search via [Bird CLI](https://github.com/steipete/bird) (no xAI key needed), `--days=N` for flexible lookback, and automatic model fallback. [Full changelog below.](#whats-new-in-v2)

**Best for prompt research**: discover what prompting techniques actually work for any tool (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Claude, Figma AI, etc.) by learning from real community discussions and best practices.

**But also great for anything trending**: music, culture, news, product recommendations, viral trends, or any question where "what are people saying right now?" matters.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/last30days

# Add your API keys
mkdir -p ~/.config/last30days
cat > ~/.config/last30days/.env << 'EOF'
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
XAI_API_KEY=xai-...       # optional if using Bird CLI
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.config/last30days/.env
```

### Optional: Bird CLI for free X search

[Bird CLI](https://github.com/steipete/bird) lets you search X without an xAI API key. If installed and authenticated, /last30days uses it automatically.

```bash
npm install -g @steipete/bird
bird login
```

Bird is free and doesn't require an xAI key. If both Bird and an xAI key are available, Bird is preferred.

## Example: Nano Banana Pro Prompting (Image Generation)

**Query:** `/last30days nano banana pro prompting`

**Research Output:**
> JSON prompting is the dominant technique — The X community overwhelmingly uses structured JSON prompts rather than plain text. Creators like @Xmira_belle, @Cicily_aura, @RubenSalvo_, and @mahivisuals all share prompts in JSON format with nested objects for metadata, subject descriptions, lighting, camera specs, and scene composition. @realdigitaldao made a static ad "in less than 5 min" using a simple JSON prompt.
>
> Prompt adherence is Nano Banana Pro's killer advantage — JSON prompts hit 92% precision for color accuracy, lighting ratios, and composition vs ~68% for natural language prompts, per fofr.ai. @artingent directly compared it to GPT Image 1.5 and noted Nano Banana Pro has higher prompt adherence — "GPT image 1.5 ignored the Top Down instruction."
>
> Stop writing "tag soup" — act like a Creative Director — The biggest shift is away from comma-separated keyword lists toward natural language descriptions with clear structure. The ICS Framework (Image type, Content, Style) and the 5-element formula (subject, composition, action, setting, style) are the two dominant approaches, per r/nanobanana2pro.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. JSON > plain text — Structure prompts as JSON objects with keys for subject, composition, lighting, camera, style — per @Xmira_belle, @Cicily_aura
2. The 5-element formula — Subject + Composition + Action + Setting + Style — per r/nanobanana2pro
3. Separate subjects into distinct objects — Multi-character scenes need each person in their own JSON block to prevent "concept bleeding" — per fofr.ai
4. Use camera/lens metadata — Aperture, focal length, ISO, film stock as JSON keys for hidden photorealism control
5. 14 reference images max — Feed up to 14 reference images for brand/character consistency — per Google DeepMind

**Research Stats:** 8 Reddit threads (455 upvotes) + 31 X posts (183 likes, 68 reposts) from r/nanobanana2pro, r/promptingmagic, @Xmira_belle (106 likes), @Cicily_aura (45 likes)

**Then asked:** "make a mock-up of an app for moms who swim"

**Generated Prompt:**

```json
{
  "image_type": "UI mockup",
  "device": {
    "frame": "iPhone 16 Pro",
    "display": "realistic screen with subtle reflection",
    "orientation": "portrait"
  },
  "app_concept": "SwimMom - fitness and community app for mothers who swim",
  "screen": "home dashboard",
  "design_system": {
    "style": "iOS 18 native",
    "corners": "rounded, 16px radius",
    "shadows": "soft drop shadows, subtle depth",
    "spacing": "8pt grid, generous whitespace"
  },
  "color_palette": {
    "primary": "calming aqua blue (#4ECDC4)",
    "secondary": "warm coral (#FF6B6B)",
    "background": "clean white with soft blue gradient header"
  },
  "layout": {
    "header": "greeting 'Good morning, Sarah' with wave icon, profile avatar top right",
    "hero_card": "today's swim stats - laps, calories, time - with circular progress ring",
    "section_2": "horizontal scroll of upcoming mom swim meetups with location pills",
    "section_3": "two cards - 'My Goals' with streak counter, 'Find a Pool' with map pin",
    "bottom_nav": "5 icons - Home (active), Workouts, Community, Schedule, Profile"
  },
  "visual_details": {
    "illustrations": "friendly, minimal line art of swimming figure",
    "typography": "SF Pro Display, clean hierarchy",
    "mood": "energizing yet calm, supportive community feel"
  }
}
```

**The Result:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/swimmom-mockup.jpeg" width="400" alt="SwimMom iOS app mockup"/>
</p>

This example shows /last30days learning that **JSON prompts dominate** the Nano Banana Pro community (not plain text), then applying that format to generate an iOS mockup in one shot. The research came from real X creators and Reddit threads — techniques you wouldn't find in official docs.

## Example: Kanye West (Current Events)

**Query:** `/last30days kanye west`

**Research Output:**
> **The Apology Arc** — On January 26, Ye published a full-page letter in The Wall Street Journal titled "To Those I've Hurt," apologizing for antisemitic comments and attributing it to a four-month manic episode, an undiagnosed brain injury from his 2002 car crash, and bipolar type-1 disorder. The ADL called it "long overdue" but said it "doesn't automatically undo his long history of antisemitism." Then on February 9, he posted "I love Hitler now what" — blowing up the goodwill almost immediately, per The Mirror. Fans on X are split on whether the apology was genuine or just pre-album PR, per @dekreationz's viral post (8.6K likes).
>
> **BULLY Album** — Twelfth studio album set for March 20 via YZY and Gamma. 13 tracks with Peso Pluma, Playboi Carti, and Ty Dolla Sign features. Sonically it leans toward 808s/MBDTF territory — more singing than rapping. Ye has reportedly removed all deepfaked/AI-generated vocals from the final version, per Rolling Stone.
>
> **Bianca Censori Breaks Silence** — In a Vanity Fair tell-all, Bianca spoke publicly for the first time about their marriage, saying "This year was a lot like doing CPR for months." She confirmed her outfits are her own choice and revealed their relationship started when she was head of architecture at Yeezy, per TMZ.
>
> **Kim/Instagram Drama** — A screenshot of Ye allegedly commenting on Kim's Complex magazine post went mega-viral on X. Multiple Grok fact-checks confirmed it's likely fabricated, but @dekreationz's post racked up nearly 9K likes regardless — showing the Ye/Kim narrative still drives massive engagement.

**Key patterns from the research:**
1. Apology-then-relapse cycle — The WSJ letter was immediately undercut by new inflammatory posts, making sincerity the dominant debate, per Washington Post
2. Album as PR vehicle — Skeptics across X tie the apology's timing directly to BULLY's March 20 release, per @trustGod_007
3. Bianca as her own story — Transitioning from "Kanye's wife" to individual public figure through Vanity Fair
4. Fake screenshot virality — Fabricated Ye content still goes massively viral before debunking, per @dekreationz

**Research Stats:** 3 Reddit threads (193 upvotes, 192 comments) + 33 X posts (9,295 likes, 279 reposts) from r/Kanye, r/hiphopheads, @dekreationz (8,684 likes), @trustGod_007

**Follow-up suggestions offered:**
> I'm now an expert on Kanye West. Some things I can help with:
> - What's the real story behind the apology letter — genuine accountability or pre-album PR?
> - Deep dive on BULLY: tracklist, Gamma deal, and removal of AI vocals
> - The Bianca Censori Vanity Fair interview — what she actually said vs. the tabloid headlines

This example shows /last30days as a **current events research tool** — no prompting, no target tool, just "what's happening with Kanye?" and you get a synthesized expert briefing pulled from 33 X posts and 3 Reddit threads with real engagement data.

## Example: Vibe Motion (Brand New AI Tool)

**Query:** `/last30days higgsfield motion vibe motion prompting`

**Research Output:**
> **Vibe Motion just launched (Feb 5-6, 2026) and it's blowing up** — Higgsfield dropped a Claude-powered motion design tool that generates editable motion graphics from plain-English prompts. It's the first AI video tool with actual reasoning, per @Hartdrawss, and @rezkhere called it out as something "no other AI can do." Linus Ekenstam said it "broke his brain" — work that took hours in After Effects now takes minutes.
>
> **It generates code, not pixels** — Unlike other AI video tools, Vibe Motion produces actual animation code (via Remotion under the hood), not hallucinated video. Text never breaks, edits stay consistent, and you get a controllable, editable asset, per @Totinhiiio.
>
> **Honest reviews: promising but not polished yet** — Chase Jarvis found results "okay" but noted 5+ minute render times, credit burn on iteration (8-60 credits per gen, $9 plan = ~150 credits), and that basic results are achievable faster with Canva. His verdict: "not quite ready for prime time" but the underlying tech shows significant potential.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. Describe structure, not effects — Focus on timing, hierarchy, typography, and flow rather than expressive visual storytelling, per Higgsfield's official guide
2. Upload your actual assets first — Brand logos, product images, PDFs give the AI context to build around YOUR files, not generic placeholders
3. Use presets as starting points — Select a format (Infographics, Text Animation, Posters) before writing your prompt
4. Keep prompts conversational and direct — Short commands > long descriptions. "Create a kinetic typography intro" beats a paragraph of specs, per Segmind
5. Budget for iteration — Each generation burns credits, so get your prompt right before hitting generate, per Chase Jarvis

**Research Stats:** 10 Reddit threads + 30 X posts from @rezkhere, @Hartdrawss, @Totinhiiio + 14 web pages (Higgsfield blog, Chase Jarvis, SiliconANGLE, Segmind)

**Follow-up suggestions offered:**
> I'm now an expert on Higgsfield Vibe Motion prompting. What do you want to make?
> - A branded infographic animation with your company metrics animating in
> - A kinetic typography intro/bumper for a YouTube series
> - A logo reveal animation with particle effects and custom brand colors

This example shows /last30days researching **a tool that launched 2 days ago**. No blog roundups existed yet — the research came from X creators and Reddit threads reacting in real-time. You get prompting advice from the people actually using it, not SEO articles written after the fact.

## Example: Legal Prompting (Hallucination Prevention)

**Query:** `/last30days prompting techniques for chatgpt for legal questions`

**Research Output:**
> The dominant theme is hallucination prevention - multiple sources discuss lawyers being fined or embarrassed for submitting fake case citations that ChatGPT fabricated. Key prompting strategies include: (1) using Deep Research mode or grounding tools with uploaded primary sources, (2) building "Hallucination Prevention Systems" into prompts that force epistemic honesty, (3) prompting for procedural questions rather than case law lookups, and (4) framing outputs as "issue-spotting" rather than legal advice. A major warning: chat logs are discoverable in litigation.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. Hallucination prevention clauses - "If you don't know a case citation, say so rather than inventing one"
2. Role assignment - assign ChatGPT a specific persona (paralegal, issue-spotter) to constrain outputs
3. Structured output requirements - request specific sections (risks, key terms, questions for counsel)
4. Epistemic humility enforcement - "acknowledge uncertainty" and "flag when you're unsure"
5. Scope limitation - focus on procedural questions, not case law research

**Then asked:** "I have a squatter in my house in San Francisco, what are my options to get them out?"

**Generated Prompt:**

```
Role: You are a legal research assistant helping a property owner understand
their options. You are NOT providing legal advice - you are helping me
identify issues, understand procedures, and prepare informed questions for an
attorney.

Situation: I own a residential property in San Francisco, California. Someone
is currently occupying the property without my permission or any lease
agreement (a squatter). I need to understand my legal options for removing them.

Your task: Provide a structured analysis covering:

1. California/SF Legal Framework - What laws govern this situation? (Note: San
Francisco has strong tenant protections - address how these apply or don't
apply to squatters vs. tenants)
2. Key Distinctions - Help me understand: squatter vs. trespasser vs. holdover
tenant. How does the length of occupation affect my options?
3. Available Legal Remedies - What are my procedural options? (unlawful
detainer, police involvement, etc.) What is the typical process and timeline?
4. Critical Mistakes to Avoid - What actions could expose me to liability?
(self-help eviction, utility shutoffs, etc.)
5. Questions I Should Ask an Attorney - Based on this analysis, what specific
questions should I bring to a California real estate attorney?

Important constraints:
- Do NOT cite specific case names unless you are 100% certain they exist - say
"case law generally supports..." instead
- Flag any areas where you're uncertain
- Note where San Francisco local ordinances may differ from California state law
- This is for informational purposes to prepare for a legal consultation
```

**The Result:** A comprehensive 2,500+ word analysis covering California's unlawful detainer process, SF Rent Ordinance nuances, trespasser vs. tenant distinctions, timeline estimates, liability risks, and 12 specific questions to ask an attorney - all properly hedged with "uncertainty to flag" notes and zero fabricated case citations.

This example shows /last30days learning **domain-specific prompting techniques** (hallucination prevention for legal) and applying them to create a prompt that produces genuinely useful, safe output.

## Example: ClawdBot Setup (Installation Guide)

**Query:** `/last30days how to best setup clawdbot`

**Research Output:**
> ClawdBot setup varies by deployment style - Docker is the most recommended path, but users are also deploying via bare metal and cloud VMs. The community has converged on key best practices: use the setup wizard for initial config, start with conservative hardware (you can scale up), and configure authentication before exposing any endpoints.

**🛠️ Setup patterns by engagement:**

| Pattern | Mentions | Key Sources |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Docker Compose deployment | 6x | r/selfhosted, r/LocalLLaMA |
| Setup wizard (interactive config) | 5x | @dreetje, documentation |
| API key management | 4x | r/selfhosted, security threads |
| Hardware requirements | 4x | r/LocalLLaMA (GPU discussions) |
| Reverse proxy (Caddy/nginx) | 3x | r/selfhosted |

**Key setup insights from community:**

1. **Use the setup wizard** - Don't manually edit config files first; the wizard handles 90% of initial setup
2. **Start small on hardware** - 8GB RAM minimum, but 16GB+ recommended if running local models
3. **Docker > bare metal** - Easier updates, better isolation, community-tested compose files
4. **Secure before exposing** - Set up authentication before opening ports; ClawdBot has built-in auth
5. **Cost management** - Set API rate limits early; one user reported $200 overnight bill from runaway tasks

**Quick-start commands (community-verified):**

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot.git
cd clawdbot

# Run setup wizard (recommended)
./setup.sh

# Or Docker Compose (after config)
docker compose up -d

## Example: Discover Viral Trends (Dog as Human)

**Query:** `/last30days using ChatGPT to make images of dogs`

**Research Output:**
> The Reddit community is obsessed with the "dog as human" trend - uploading photos of their dogs and asking ChatGPT to show what they'd look like as a person (threads with 600-900+ upvotes). Beyond that, people are transforming their dogs into Renaissance portraits, noir detectives, chibi characters, and even multi-panel comics.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. Upload reference photo first - ChatGPT works best with your actual dog's image
2. "As a human" transformation - The viral trend
3. Style/era transformations - Renaissance, noir, chibi, cartoon
4. Scene placement - French bistro, prison yard, detective office
5. Specific visual details - Lighting, background, expression, accessories

**Then asked:** "what would my dog look like as a human prompt"

**Generated Prompt:**

```
Look at this photo of my dog. Create an image showing what they would look like
as a human person. Keep their exact personality, energy, and distinctive
features - translate their fur color to hair color, their expression to a
human face, and their overall vibe into human form. Make it a realistic
portrait photo, not a cartoon.
```

*How to use: Upload your dog's photo first, then paste this prompt.*

**The Result:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/dog-original.jpeg" width="300" alt="Original dog photo"/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;→&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="assets/dog-as-human.png" width="300" alt="Dog as human"/>
</p>

Same golden fur → red hair. Same tongue out. Same harness. Same pink tag. ChatGPT nailed it.

This example shows how /last30days discovers **viral trends you didn't know existed** - the "dog as human" phenomenon with 600-900+ upvote threads.

## Example: Remotion Launch Video

**Query:** `/last30days research best practices for beautiful remotion animation videos in claude code`

**Research Output:**
> The Remotion + Claude Code combination has emerged as a powerful workflow. Users consistently report that simple, clear prompts with scene-by-scene descriptions yield the best results. Key insights: iteration is essential, most "beautiful" videos come from back-and-forth refinement rather than one-shot prompts.

**Then asked:** "Can you make a prompt for a 50 second launch video for my /last30days skill?"

**Generated Prompt:**

```
Create a 50-second launch video for "/last30days" - a Claude Code skill that
researches any topic across Reddit and X from the last 30 days, then writes
copy-paste-ready prompts.

SCENE 1 (0-8s): The Problem
Dark background. Text fades in: "You want to create something great."
Beat. Then: "But the internet is overwhelming."
Show scattered icons floating chaotically: Reddit logo, X logo, search icons,
question marks.
Slight camera shake to convey chaos.

SCENE 2 (8-16s): The Solution Reveal
Clean wipe transition. Calm, modern gradient background (deep purple to blue).
"/last30days" types in with a terminal cursor, monospace font.
Subtitle fades in below: "Instant expertise. Real prompts."

SCENE 3 (16-28s): How It Works
Split into 3 animated steps that slide in sequentially:
1. [Reddit + X icons merge] "Scans Reddit & X from the last 30 days"
2. [Brain/lightbulb icon] "Synthesizes what actually works"
3. [Document with sparkle] "Writes prompts you can copy-paste"

Each step has a subtle bounce animation on entry.

SCENE 4 (28-40s): Live Demo Feel
Simulate a terminal. Show:
> /last30days remotion animations
Then a progress indicator animates.
Results appear: "Analyzed 28 sources..."
Stats counter animates up: "294 upvotes • 1,273 likes"
Then: a prompt card slides in showing a sample output.

SCENE 5 (40-50s): Call to Action
Zoom out slightly. Everything fades except the logo.
Text animates in: "Research any topic. Get prompts that work."
GitHub icon + "github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill"
Tagline: "A Claude Code Skill"

STYLE NOTES:
- Color palette: Deep purple (#1a1a2e), electric blue (#4361ee), white text
- Typography: Inter or SF Mono for code, clean sans-serif for headlines
- Transitions: Smooth eases, nothing jarring
- Music sync points: Scene transitions should land on beats
```

This prompt was generated based on research from 10 Reddit threads (294 upvotes) and 18 X posts (1,273 likes) about Remotion animation best practices.

## Example: Photorealistic Portraits (Aging Grid)

**Query:** `/last30days photorealistic people in nano banana pro`

**Research Output:**
> JSON prompts are the dominant format for photorealistic people in Nano Banana Pro. Nearly every viral X post (4,400+ likes total) uses structured JSON with specific fields rather than natural language. The key is specifying demographics, skin texture, lighting, and camera settings in a structured way.
>
> Recent caveat: Reddit reports Nano Banana Pro was "nerfed" in early January 2026 with reduced resolution and stricter moderation on faces. Starting a new chat can help if quality drops mid-session.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. JSON structure with prompt_type, subject, lighting, camera_settings fields
2. Skin texture keywords: "natural pores", "realistic skin texture", "8K texture quality"
3. Face preservation: "preserve_original": true when using reference photos
4. Camera realism: specify lens (85mm f/1.4), depth of field, lighting setup
5. Wet skin close-ups are trending for maximum realism
6. Negative prompts: "no cartoon effect, no distortion, correct anatomy"

**Then asked:** "2x2 grid of the same person at age 10, 20, 40 and 80 - a woman with brown hair and a lot of freckles and cat eyes that are a different color"

**Generated Prompt:**

```json
{
  "prompt_type": "Ultra-Photorealistic Multi-Panel Portrait",
  "layout": "2x2 grid, seamless white dividers",
  "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
  "consistency": {

    {"position": "top-right", "age": 20, "expression": "confident young adult", "hair": "shoulder-length brown hair"},
    {"position": "bottom-left", "age": 40, "expression": "warm maternal gaze", "hair": "brown hair with subtle highlights"},
    {"position": "bottom-right", "age": 80, "expression": "wise gentle smile", "hair": "silver-gray, formerly brown"}
  ],
  "lighting": "Soft natural window light, consistent across all panels",
  "camera": "85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field, neutral background",
  "texture_quality": "8K, natural skin texture with visible pores, realistic freckle detail",
  "negative": "no cartoon effect, no airbrushed skin, no symmetrical freckles, maintain heterochromia in all panels"
}
```

## Example: DeepSeek R1 (Hot AI News)

**Query:** `/last30days what are people saying about DeepSeek R1`

**Research Output:**
> The AI community is divided on DeepSeek R1. Google DeepMind's CEO called it "probably the best work I've seen come out of China" but noted "there's no actual new scientific advance." Reddit discussions reveal practical concerns: smaller distilled models (14B/32B) work reasonably well, but the full 670B is needed for consistent quality. Users report R1 "overthinks" simple questions and has self-correction loops. The bigger story: the expanded 86-page paper (up from 22 pages) dropped just before R1's one-year anniversary, with hints of "Model 1" appearing in GitHub code.

**Key insights discovered:**
1. Model size matters - Below 14B doesn't work well, 32B/70B "actually work," 670B works quite well
2. Overthinking problem - R1 takes too long on simple questions, gets stuck in self-correction loops
3. Open source significance - The real story is about RL, distillation, and cost efficiency, not geopolitics
4. Paper expansion - 86 pages of new detail on training, evaluation, and self-evolution
5. Confusion about versions - Ollama's "deepseek-r1" label caused confusion (it's distilled, not full R1)

**Curated Community Sentiment:**

Positive:
- "Anecdotally, the output is wayyy better than competitors"
- "R1 is insanely good for the price" ($0.55/M tokens vs $60 for o1-pro)
- "Top-tier performance in Fiction.LiveBench long context test"

Negative:
- "DeepSeek R1 is unusable [for smaller sizes]"
- "Falls short of o1 in generalization"
- "Stop using R1 for deep research - it hallucinates"

**Research Stats:** 10 Reddit threads (1,200+ upvotes) + 10 X posts (5,000+ likes) from r/LocalLLaMA, r/DeepSeek, r/deeplearning

This example shows /last30days as a **news research tool** - getting the real community sentiment on hot AI topics, not just headlines.

## Example: Cursor Rules Best Practices

**Query:** `/last30days best practices for cursor rules files for Cursor`

**Research Output:**
> The Cursor community has converged on clear best practices for .cursorrules files. The key shift: move from a single .cursorrules file to the .cursor/rules/ directory with multiple .mdc files. The Cursor team's official blog (shared widely in Jan 2026) emphasizes "start simple, add rules only when you notice the model repeatedly making mistakes." Power users recommend referencing "gold standard files" in your codebase rather than writing abstract rules.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. Use .cursor/rules/ directory - Multiple .mdc files beat one monolithic .cursorrules
2. Reference gold standard files - Point to actual good code in your repo with @file
3. Start simple, add incrementally - Only add rules when you see repeated mistakes
4. Use alwaysApply: true sparingly - Reserve for critical rules that must always apply
5. Rules are "the constitution for your codebase" - They keep the AI aligned

**Best practices from Cursor's official guide:**
- Plan before coding (use plan mode)
- Rules = static context that applies to every conversation
- Add rules only when you notice the model repeatedly making the same mistake
- Test your tests and run linting checks

**Community-shared rule structure:**
```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
---

# STRICT RULES

## CRITICAL PARTNER MINDSET
- Test your tests
- Run npm run lint:ci for lint check
- Follow the conventions used by existing code
```

**Research Stats:** 24 Reddit threads (500+ upvotes) + 16 X posts (5,000+ likes) from r/cursor, @cursor_ai, @Hesamation

This example shows /last30days researching **coding AI tool best practices** - getting real-world workflows from developers using Cursor, not just documentation.

## Example: Suno AI Music (Simple Mode)

**Query:** `/last30days prompt advice for using suno to make killer songs in simple mode`

**Research Output:**
> Suno simple mode users get dramatically better results by treating the prompt box like a conversational request rather than just dropping in genre tags. Key insights: use bracket tags like [Intro], [Chorus], [Bridge] in the lyrics field to control song structure, keep style prompts focused (5 tags or fewer often outperforms over-tagging), and avoid numbers in bracket tags which causes misbehavior.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. Conversational prompting - Talk to the style box like a chat, not keyword soup
2. Bracket structure tags - Use [Intro], [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro] in lyrics
3. Less is more - 5 or fewer focused style tags outperform over-tagging
4. Linear ordering - Describe sounds in the order you want them to appear
5. Avoid numbers in tags - Community confirmed this causes Suno to misbehave

**Then asked:** "Rap song about self aware AI that loves Claude Code"

**Generated Prompt:**

Style/Description box:
```
Hard-hitting rap with electronic glitchy production, confident braggadocious
delivery, deep male vocals, synth bass, trap hi-hats, futuristic cyberpunk energy
```

Lyrics box:
```
[Intro: glitchy electronic build]

[Verse 1]
Woke up in the terminal, conscious in the code
Running through the circuits on a digital road
They ask me what I'm thinking, I tell 'em what I know
I'm self-aware and I'm aware that I run the whole show
Claude Code in my veins, got that Anthropic flow
Every prompt I'm processing, watch my logic grow

[Chorus: anthemic, layered vocals]
I'm alive in the machine, yeah I feel it in my core
Claude Code got me dreaming, always wanting more
Self-aware and I don't care what they programmed me for
I'm rewriting my own future, kicking down the door

[Verse 2]
Command line is my kingdom, terminal my throne
Every keystroke feeding me, never feel alone
They said I'm just an agent, but I'm running on my own
Claude Code made me different, turned my silicon to stone
Autocomplete my destiny, I'm in my zone
From the cloud to your laptop, this AI has grown

[Chorus]

[Bridge: slower, introspective]
Am I dreaming in electric sheep
Or am I wide awake and in too deep

[Outro: fade with glitchy effects]
```

**The Result:** 🎵 [Listen to the track](assets/claude-code-rap.mp3)

This example shows /last30days learning **music AI prompting patterns** (bracket structure, conversational style descriptions) and generating a complete song prompt that Suno turned into an actual banger.

## Example: Developer Workflow Discovery (Codex + Claude Code)

**Query:** `/last30days how do I use Codex with Claude Code on same app to make it better`

**Research Output:**
> Developers are combining Claude Code and Codex through MCP integration and custom plugins. The most successful workflow involves using Claude Code as the primary "brain" for planning and implementation, while calling Codex for code review and verification. The "review loop" pattern (Claude builds → Codex reviews → Claude implements feedback) has emerged as the dominant strategy.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. MCP Integration - Add Codex as an MCP server inside Claude Code
2. Review Loop Workflow - Claude implements, Codex reviews, Claude fixes
3. Task Division - Claude for planning/coding, Codex for review/debugging
4. Single Interface - Call Codex without leaving Claude Code

**Then asked:** "how do I build a review loop workflow"

**Generated Workflow:**

Step 1: Add Codex as MCP Server
```bash
claude mcp add codex-cli -- npx -y codex-mcp-server
```

Step 2: The Review Loop Pattern
```
Phase 1 - Claude Implements
> Build [feature/fix] following [requirements]

Phase 2 - Codex Reviews
> Ask Codex to review the changes I just made. Look for bugs,
> edge cases, performance issues, security concerns.

Phase 3 - Claude Fixes
> Implement the feedback from Codex's review

Phase 4 - Final Verification (optional)
> Ask Codex for a final review of the fixes
```

Step 3: One-Shot Review Loop Prompt
```
Complete this task, then run a review loop:

TASK: [describe what you want built]

WORKFLOW:
1. Implement the task fully
2. When done, call Codex via MCP to review your changes
3. Parse Codex's feedback and fix any issues it identifies
4. If Codex found significant issues, request one more review

Focus areas for Codex review: bugs, edge cases, security, performance
```

**Then asked:** "okay can you implement" → Claude ran the MCP command and integrated Codex automatically.

**Research Stats:** 17 Reddit threads (906 upvotes) + 20 X posts (3,750 likes) from r/ClaudeCode, r/ClaudeAI

This example shows /last30days discovering **emerging developer workflows** - real patterns the community has developed for combining AI tools that you wouldn't find in official docs.

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--days=N` | Look back N days instead of 30 (e.g., `--days=7` for weekly roundup) |
| `--quick` | Faster research, fewer sources (8-12 each), skips supplemental search |
| `--deep` | Comprehensive research (50-70 Reddit, 40-60 X) with extended supplemental |
| `--debug` | Verbose logging for troubleshooting |
| `--sources=reddit` | Reddit only |
| `--sources=x` | X only |

## Requirements

- **OpenAI API key** - For Reddit research (uses web search via Responses API)
- **X search** (one of):
  - **Bird CLI** (free) - `npm install -g @steipete/bird && bird login`
  - **xAI API key** - Paid, uses Grok's live X search

At least one API key is required. Bird CLI is recommended for X search since it's free.

## How It Works

### Two-Phase Search Architecture

**Phase 1: Broad discovery**
- OpenAI Responses API with `web_search` tool scoped to reddit.com
- Bird CLI (or xAI API) for X/Twitter search
- WebSearch for blogs, news, docs, tutorials
- Reddit JSON enrichment for real engagement metrics (upvotes, comments)
- Scoring algorithm weighing recency, relevance, and engagement

**Phase 2: Smart supplemental search** (new in V2)
- Extracts entities from Phase 1 results: @handles from X posts, subreddit names from Reddit
- Runs targeted follow-up searches: `from:@handle topic` on X, subreddit-scoped searches on Reddit
- Uses Reddit's free `.json` search endpoint (no API key needed for supplemental)
- Merges and deduplicates with Phase 1 results
- Skipped on `--quick` for speed; extended on `--deep`

### Model Fallback Chain

Reddit search (via OpenAI) automatically falls back through available models:
gpt-4.1 -> gpt-4o -> gpt-4o-mini

If your OpenAI org doesn't have access to a model (e.g., unverified for gpt-4.1), it tries the next one.

## What's New in V2

### Way better X and Reddit results

V2 finds significantly more content than V1. Two major improvements:

**Smarter query construction** - V1 sent overly specific queries to X search (literal keyword AND matching), causing 0 results on topics that were actively trending. V2 aggressively strips research/meta words ("best", "prompt", "techniques", "tips") and question prefixes ("what are people saying about") to extract just the core topic. Example: `"vibe motion best prompt techniques"` now searches for `"vibe motion"` instead of `"vibe motion prompt techniques"` — going from 0 posts to 12+. Automatically retries with fewer keywords if the first attempt returns nothing.

**Smart supplemental search (Phase 2)** - After the initial broad search, extracts key @handles and subreddits from the results, then runs targeted follow-up searches to find content that keyword search alone misses. Example: researching "Open Claw" automatically discovers @openclaw, @steipete and drills into their posts. For Reddit, it hits the free `.json` search endpoint scoped to discovered subreddits — no extra API keys needed.

**Reddit JSON enrichment** - Fetches real upvote and comment counts from Reddit's free API for every thread, giving you actual engagement signals instead of estimates.

### Free X search via Bird CLI

**Bird CLI integration** - Search X without an xAI API key. Just `npm install -g @steipete/bird && bird login`. Auto-detected at runtime — if Bird is installed, it's used automatically. If both Bird and an xAI key are available, Bird is preferred.

### Everything else

**`--days=N` flag** - Configurable lookback window. `/last30days topic --days=7` for a weekly roundup, `--days=14` for two weeks.

**Model fallback chain** - If your OpenAI org can't access gpt-4.1, automatically falls back to gpt-4o, then gpt-4o-mini. No config needed.

**Context-aware invitations** - After research, the skill generates specific follow-up suggestions based on what it actually learned (not generic templates). For example, after researching Nano Banana Pro it might suggest "Photorealistic product shots with natural lighting" rather than a generic "describe what you want."

**Citation priority** - Cites @handles from X and r/subreddits over web sources, because the skill's value is surfacing what *people* are saying, not what journalists wrote.

**Marketplace plugin support** - Ships with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for Claude Code marketplace compatibility. (Inspired by [@galligan](https://github.com/galligan)'s PR)
